# Templates
This document provides some SPARQL and Python codes for accessing ontologies and linked data. I used this information in a part of my research, which was about the use of ontologies in question classification and resolution in neuroscience.

I used a template-based approach to tackle and resolve questions. Here, I listed some necessary codes for working with ontologies, some extended templates and examples on how to use them.

I am currently working on an application, based on my research outcomes and templates mentioned here, called NeuroTemple.
